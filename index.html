      <h2 id="main-bio">About Me:</h2>
      <p> I graduated from Columbia College Hollywood with a BFA in Cinema Producing and Screenwriting. Immediately
        after
        graduation I worked for Warner Bros on a hit television show. After I left the show, I became certified as a
        therapeutic riding instructor with the Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship, INTL. I have
        worked
        with a non-profit for the last several years, and decided I needed to make another change. I have been
        enjoying
        coding and will be updating this section as class progresses.</p>
